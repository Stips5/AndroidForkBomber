# AndroidForkBomber

AndroidForkBomber is going to crush your phone in just few seconds (If you have root access).
Its made for fun, I am not responsible for eventual damage on your phone (after your phone freezes you should yuste restart it by removing battery or reset it holding power key for few seconds).
